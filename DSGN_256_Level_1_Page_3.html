        <span><br><b>Uncle Ben</b> meant the <em><i>world</i></em> to us.<br>&nbsp;<br>But he wouldn't want us living <b>one second</b> with <em><i>revenge</i></em> in our hearts.<br>
        </span>&nbsp;<br>It's like a <b>poison</b>.<br>&nbsp;<br>It can - It can <em><i>take you over</i>.</em><br>&nbsp;<br>
        <span>Before you know it, turn us into <b>something ugly</b>.<br>&nbsp;</span><body>

        <span><br><br>This is one of my favorite quotes from a Spider-Man movie for several reasons:</span>
        <span><ol><li>It represents a heavy moment of foreshadowing in the film, wherein Peter's will is tested as he chooses between using his newfound, mysterious black Spider-Man suit, or his staying true to his classic red and blue outfit.</li></span>
        <span><li>It signifies the beginning of Peter's descent into a destructive state of mind and way of living that effectively pushes away everyone he cares about, making him miserable—a result of the alien symbiote's dark influence on his character that amplifies his personal faults and baggage.</li></span>
        <span><li>It encapsulates the film's theme of how our choices can havae monumental effects on ourselves and those around us. After all, one of the slogans touted on the movie posters was "Every hero has a choice."</li></ol></span></p>

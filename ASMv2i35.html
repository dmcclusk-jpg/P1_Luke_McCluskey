<p>Excerpt<br><br>
Hello, God...This is Peter Parker. Can I ask a favor?<br><br>
I know I've been your personal cat toy for the past few years...but can we not do that to me again for a while?<br><br>
Not real long. I know the odds on that are about zero...but just for a little while.<br><br>
Say, 50 or 60 years? I mean, that's not long in your terms, right?<br><br>
Just kidding God, just kidding.<br><br>
But I'll bet you knew that, didn't you?<br><br></p>
